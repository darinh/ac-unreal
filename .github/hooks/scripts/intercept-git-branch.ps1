# preToolUse hook: intercept in-place branch creation and redirect to the
# create-new-branch skill (which creates a worktree under .worktrees/).
#
# Triggers a deny verdict for any of these branch-creation forms,
# including the attached-arg variant (-bfoo) and git's global-option
# prefix (git -c key=val checkout -b foo):
#   - git checkout -b/-B <branch>        (short, separated)
#   - git checkout -b<branch>            (short, attached)
#   - git switch   -c/-C <branch>        (short, separated)
#   - git switch   -c<branch>            (short, attached)
#   - git switch   --create <branch>     (long)
#   - git switch   --force-create <branch>
#
# `git` must be in command position — at start-of-string or after a
# real shell command separator (;, &&, ||, |, backtick, newline).
# Plain whitespace is NOT a separator, so harmless text like
# `echo git checkout -b demo` (a literal string passed to echo) is
# correctly allowed.
#
# All other inputs (including bare `git checkout <branch>`, file
# reverts, `git worktree add`, malformed JSON, empty stdin, missing
# fields) emit `{}` so normal tool execution proceeds.
#
# Known limitations (documented, not bugs):
#   - Deliberate nested-shell wrappers like `bash -lc 'git checkout
#     -b foo'` or `cmd /c "git checkout -b foo"` evade the regex
#     because `git` is preceded by a quote, not by a command-position
#     separator. Defending against this would require full shell-quote
#     parsing, which is intractable in a hook regex and pulls in
#     false-positives on innocent quoted text. The expectation is
#     that agents follow AGENTS.md; deliberate evasion is a different
#     trust problem and is partially backstopped by git-side hooks
#     (a future companion piece).
#   - `git branch <newname>` (creates a ref without checkout) is not
#     intercepted because it doesn't put the user "on" the branch.
#     If you `git branch foo && git switch foo`, the second command
#     is allowed.
#
# Why fail-open on errors: per the hooks reference, non-zero exits
# are logged and skipped — they never block agent execution.
# Emitting `{}` explicitly is the safe documented allow path.
#
# Schema (deny verdict, flat):
#   { "permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..." }
# Schema (allow): {} or empty stdout.

This repo uses an isolated-worktree branch workflow. Branches are created
inside .worktrees/<task-id>/ so the main checkout stays clean and parallel
work doesn't collide. Two ways forward:

1. Invoke the create-new-branch skill (preferred):
   Follow the runbook at .github/skills/create-new-branch/SKILL.md
   with task_id='$taskId'. It creates .worktrees/$taskId/, sets the
   branch to anvil/$taskId, and moves the working directory into it.

2. Or run the equivalent manually from the repo root:
   git worktree add -b anvil/$taskId .worktrees/$taskId <base-branch>

See AGENTS.md > Branch workflow for the rule. This hook lives at
.github/hooks/enforce-worktree-branching.json and intercepts
'git checkout -b/-B' and 'git switch -c/-C' across all sessions.
